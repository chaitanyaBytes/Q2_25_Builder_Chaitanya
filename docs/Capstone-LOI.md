# Capstone Letter of Intent (LOI)

## Project Overview

### Capstone Project Name/Idea
Ruglette - On-chain meme coin Roulette

### Brief Project Description
Ruglette is an on-chain, meme-fueled Russian roulette-style game built on the Solana blockchain. Players spin a digital chamber filled with randomized meme coins, where each spin can result in mooning tokens or complete rugs. With on-chain randomness, non-custodial escrow, and chaotic gameplay, Ruglette gamifies the volatility and humor of meme coin culture.

### Reason for Choosing this Project
Ruglette represents a fusion of my passion for building fun, experimental products and my interest in the meme coin-driven culture that defines much of the Solana ecosystem. I chose this project because I see a gap in the market for community-first, culturally resonant on-chain games that are both technically sound and deeply entertaining. Most existing on-chain games focus on either serious gambling or traditional gameplay mechanics. Ruglette, on the other hand, embraces unpredictability and humor in a way that feels native to crypto. It also gives me an opportunity to deepen my skills in smart contract development, randomness integration, and front-end dApp design, while creating something that could go viral and be loved by the degen community.

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Target Audience
- Solana degens and meme coin traders who thrive on volatility and chaos
- On-chain gamblers seeking high-risk, high-reward entertainment
- NFT and web3 communities that engage with culturally relevant, humorous dApps
- Normal users who just want to try out on-chain roulette for having fun with their friends

### Value Proposition
- Provides a fair and transparent gambling experience using verifiable randomness (VRF)
- Taps into meme coin culture to create a uniquely engaging and humorous on-chain game
- Offers a viral, community-first alternative to traditional DeFi applications
- Randomized meme coin spins ensure replayability and fresh gameplay each session

#### For v2
- Seasonal chambers and community-submitted tokens deepen user involvement and virality
- Custom room logic where users can jump in with their friends and play with them privately
- Enables token creators to gain visibility through integration and potential sponsorships

### Marketing and Distribution
- Launch teaser trailers and memes on Twitter/X targeting Solana communities
- Collaborate with meme coin projects to feature their tokens in-game
- Partner with Solana influencers and degen spaces to demo Ruglette
- Run community competitions and leaderboard events
- Share gameplay clips and losses/wins for social virality

### Competitive Landscape
While there are several on-chain roulette and casino-style games on Solana, these platforms primarily replicate traditional casino experiences and focus on classic tokens or stablecoins. They often emphasize serious, high-stakes gameplay with limited cultural relevance. In contrast, Ruglette injects meme coin chaos into the roulette format, turning volatility and humor into core mechanics. Unlike competitors, Ruglette:

- Randomizes real and trending meme coins as gameplay elements instead of fixed outcomes or symbols
- Embraces the cultural identity of Solana's degen ecosystem by prioritizing memes, virality, and chaos
- Offers a lighter, fun-first approach where users don't just betâ€”they gamble with cultural relevance

## Technical Details

### Tech Stack
- **Blockchain:** Solana
- **Smart Contracts:** Anchor (Rust)
- **Frontend:** Next.js + TailwindCSS
- **Wallet Integration:** via Solana Wallet Adapter (Phantom or backpack)
- **Randomness:** Switchboard VRF or Pyth VRF

### Smart Contract Developer
Smart contracts will be written in Rust using the Anchor framework. Contracts will handle staking, randomness requests, outcome resolution, and payouts.

### Testing
Unit testing, integration testing, and security audits will be conducted to ensure the reliability and security of the smart contracts. Basic security measures will include access control checks, limits on max bet size, and VRF verification.

### Formal Verification
Explore the use of formal verification tools to mathematically prove the correctness of the contracts.

## Conclusion

### Project Timeline
1. Week 1: Finalize game mechanics and smart contract architecture
2. Week 2 - 3: Develop and test smart contracts locally and on Devnet
3. Week 4- 5: Build front-end and integrate with on-chain logic
4. Week 6: Launch beta version with limited spins and community testing

### Commitment
I am fully committed to completing Ruglette as a capstone project. This project aligns with my passion for on-chain gaming and my interest in building unique, viral, and community-centered experiences on Solana. I intend to contribute meaningfully to the blockchain ecosystem by building something fun, transparent, and technically sound.
